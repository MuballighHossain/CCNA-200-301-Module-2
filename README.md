From AIUB Institute of Continuing Education, I completed the CCNA Module 2 in September and learned the following concepts:

Ethernet Fundamentals: Understanding Ethernet standards, frame structure, and types of Ethernet connections.

Switching Concepts: Learning about the role of switches in networks, MAC addresses, and the process of frame forwarding.

VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks): Configuring VLANs, understanding VLAN tagging, and benefits of VLANs in network segmentation.

Inter-VLAN Routing: Techniques for enabling communication between VLANs, including using a router or a Layer 3 switch.

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP): Understanding STPâ€™s role in preventing network loops and its operation.

Switch Configuration: Basic switch configuration tasks, including setting up interfaces and security features.

Port Security: Implementing security measures to protect switch ports from unauthorized access.

Link Aggregation: Learning how to combine multiple switch ports to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy.

Basic Troubleshooting: Identifying and resolving common network issues related to switching and VLANs.

These topics lay a solid foundation for building and managing efficient networks!
